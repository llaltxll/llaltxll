### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a hobbyist programmer and data analyst, this github profile holds some of my coding projects and experiments.

I currently work as a dispatcher in a large distribution and logistics company.
I am a very inquisitive person by nature which is why I have a wide array of interests, this profile is one of my creative outlets.
